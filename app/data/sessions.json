        "description": "gRPC is a language-neutral, platform-neutral RPC framework and toolset which is based on the finalized HTTP/2 standard and developed and open sourced by Google. It can be used to build highly performant, scalable APIs by allowing developers to define services using a powerful binary serialization toolset and language called Protocol Buffers. It can also be used to generate idiomatic client and server stubs from service definitions written in a variety of languages. In this session you’ll learn all about gRPC and how it benefits from being based on HTTP/2 and through the use of a working demo and detailed code examples you’ll learn how to build gRPC enabled microservices and clients.",

Do you even have or use a car in London? If not then you might not care.  Anyway, come and find out how I used an Android phone, an embedded bluetooth sensor, Google Maps and a whole load of Google Cloud Services to figure out what was happening under the hood.  Plus, for an extra bonus, we will go into detail of some the Easter Eggs and features that now available in Google Maps App as well as some other fun things you might not know about Google Maps.  You'll never look at a Google map the same way again! ",
